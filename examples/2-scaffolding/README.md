## About

❗️Note that this example does not run a client or server, it just scaffolds the models.

This example shows a minimal example of how to configure the code scaffolding, if you have some schema available somewhere.

## Usage

#### 0. install `mst-gql` dependencies (within the parent `mst-gql` directory)

```bash
yarn
```

#### 1. Install dependencies (within this example's folder)

```bash
yarn
```

#### 2. Scaffold

```bash
yarn start
```

Runs the scaffolder and uses TypeScript to compile the generated sources.

```bash
yarn download
```

Re-fetches the graphql-schema from the demo endpoint (this might take a while). The schema definition is downloaded from: https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/
