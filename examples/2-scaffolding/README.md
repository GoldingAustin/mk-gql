# Scaffolding example

This example shows a minimal example of how to configure the code scaffolding, if you have some schema available somewhere.

`yarn start` Runs the scaffolder and uses TypeScript to compile the generated sources.

`yarn download` Re-fetches the graphql-schema from the demo endpoint (this might take a while). The schema definition is downloaded from: https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/ (TODO: there must be a much faster way than downloading apollo first ðŸ™ˆ)
