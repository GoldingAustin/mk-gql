Based on the [apollo full-stack tutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial/tree/d780ec0ceed274fdc296eebfaf20d54499e8ea31/final)

Getting started

Create an `.env` file in the `server/` directory, and fill it like `ENGINE_API_KEY=service:user-XXX:XXXX`. It can be obtained, ehhh, somewhere in here: https://engine.apollographql.com/

```bash
cd server
yarn
yarn start

cd ../client
yarn
yarn start
```
